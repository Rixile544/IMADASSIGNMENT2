# 📚 Flashcard Quiz App (Kotlin)

Hey! This is a simple Android app made using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. It's meant to help users (like students or anyone studying) practice using flashcards. The app has 5 questions that are True/False and gives you a score at the end based on how well you did.

## 🚀 What it does

Basically, it runs a short quiz with 5 questions. You answer each one (by tapping True or False), then it tells you if you're right or wrong. After all 5 questions are done, you'll see your score and some feedback. You can also go back and review the answers if you want.

## 🖼️ Screens in the App

### 🏁 Welcome Screen:
- A short welcome message.
- A button that says **Start** which takes you into the quiz.

### ❓ Flashcard Question Screen:
- One question at a time.
- Two answer buttons: **True** and **False**.
- Feedback after you answer (like "Correct!" or "Nope, that's wrong").
- A **Next** button to move to the next question.

### 🏆 Score Screen:
- Shows your total score (out of 5).
- Gives you some feedback:
  - "Great job!" if you get 3 or more.
  - "Keep practising!" if less than 3.
- A **Review** button so you can look at the questions and the right answers.
- An **Exit** button to close the app.

## 🔧 How it works

We use 2 arrays:
- One has all the questions (5 of them).
- The other one has the correct answers (true or false).

The app loops through each question when you tap **Next**. It checks your answer, shows feedback, and adds to your score if you're right.

After the last question, it jumps to the Score Screen.

## 💻 Stuff Used

- Kotlin  
- Android Studio  
- GitHub (for version control)  
- GitHub Actions (to do builds/checks automatically)

## 🧪 GitHub Actions

Set up to:
- Check if the code builds
- Do some basic testing
- Helps make sure you didn’t break stuff without realizing it 😅

## 📝 Example Questions

1. "Nelson Mandela was the president in 1994" – True  
2. "The capital of South Africa is Johannesburg" – False  
3. "The human body has four lungs" – False  
4. "The sun rises in the East" – True  
5. "There are 26 letters in the English alphabet" – True

## 🧠 Notes

- Code is commented so it's easy to follow if you're new to Android or Kotlin.
- Nothing too crazy here – just a clean, functional flashcard app for practice.
